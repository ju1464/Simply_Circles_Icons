# Simply_Circles_Icon_Theme
Monochromatic and simple icons with  little  brush strokes of color.
These icons are created by me from scratch, although they are inspired by the malys uniblack icon theme, which is unattended since 2012.
They are in white and in black, and probably in the future I will make them in different colors.
